============ Renewable Energy Production Prediction ============ 
== Context == 
The main challenge in the transition to clean energies—among them the most famous, solar and wind—presents a hurdle: intermittency. 
Unlike fossil sources, renewable production depends on climatic factors that tend to be temporal variables. 
Being able to accurately predict how much energy will be produced per hour allows for cost reduction and improved energy efficiency for cities based on their consumption.

== Dataset == 
The analysis is based on the file Energy Production Dataset.csv, which contains 51,864 energy production records.

- Frequency: Production is recorded hourly (Start_Hour, End_Hour).

- Energy Sources: Solar, Wind, and Mixed.

- Key Variables: Date, day of the year, season, and production units.

- Data Quality: Overlaps in schedules during seasonal time changes were detected and analyzed, and 402 outliers were identified—likely the result of storms or acyclic weather changes—using the Z-Score method.

== Objective == 
Develop a regression model capable of predicting Energy Production for the next hour, using historical data and cyclical temporal variables.

== Methodology == 
- The project follows a standard Data Science workflow:

- Exploratory Analysis: Identification of trends by source type and analysis of each season.

- Cleaning: Data type conversion, handling of hourly overlaps, and management of null values after lag creation.

- Feature Engineering.

- Cyclical Encoding: Transformation of hours and days into Sine/Cosine functions for model training; this ensures the model understands that hour 0 and 23 are close.

- Lag Variables: Creation of production columns from 1 hour ago (prod_lag_1h) and 24 hours ago (prod_lag_24h).

- Moving Averages: Calculation of the average production of the last 3 hours to capture the immediate trend.

Model: Implementation of a Random Forest Regressor algorithm.

== Results ==

- The model demonstrates a high predictive capacity by capturing the inertia of energy production:

- R² Score: 0.9807

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 358.87 units.

- Real-time Prediction: The notebook includes a final function where, by entering the energy type and the previous hour's production, the model returns the estimated production (taking the MAE into account).

== Limitations ==

- Lack of Climatic Data: The model only considers past predictions; it lacks real-time data to predict sudden changes such as storms or increased solar radiation.

- Outliers: There are very high production peaks interpreted as storm days that generated peaks of 23,000 units produced; although these outliers were not taken into account for this analysis,
they could slightly affect the model's training.

- Analyst's Experience: One of my first freelance projects where the lack of experience could lead me to make some not-so-correct decisions; I don't rule out improving this work in the future ;)

== Future Improvements ==

- Climate API Integration: Incorporate real-time meteorological data to improve accuracy.

- Dashboard: Create a visual interface (Streamlit) to visualize predictions interactively.
